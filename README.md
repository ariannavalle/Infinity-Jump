# Infinity Jump

[Live Demo](https://ariannavalle.github.io/Infinity-Jump/)

Infinity Jump was inspired by nostalgia. It is a remake of "Doodle Jump", a game I used to play years ago when times were simpler, and games weren't infested with ads.

In Infinity Jump, the player bounces up different platforms, moving left and right with the arrow keys.
The objective is to get as high as possible without falling or crashing into a monster.
